        <p>Equestrian sports, celebrated for their elegance, strength, and the unique partnership between horse and rider, are beloved by many across the world. However, they also carry a significant level of risk. Horses are unpredictable animals, and despite the most rigorous training, accidents can and do happen. According to the American Medical Equestrian Association, approximately 20% of equestrians will suffer a serious injury at some point in their riding careers. Whether it’s a fall from a horse, being kicked, or even an accident during competition, the risks are real and can lead to costly medical bills, property damage, or even long-term disability.</p>
